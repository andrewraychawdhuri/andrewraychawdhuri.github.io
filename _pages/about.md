Welcome! My name is Andrew and I am currently a second year PhD student in economics at the University of Maryland. My fields of research are industrial organization and econometrics. I earned my BA in economics from UCLA in 2022 and started my PhD in 2024 after working as a Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for two years. I am working on updating this site to include my current research and other projects that I am working on so bear with me as I continually update this page with more info!
