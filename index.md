Welcome! My name is Andrew and I am currently a second year PhD student in economics at the University of Maryland.  

My fields of research are **industrial organization** and **econometrics**.  

I earned my BA in economics from UCLA in 2022 and started my PhD in 2024 after working as a Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for two years.  

I am working on updating this site to include my current research and other projects that I am working on â€” so bear with me as I continually update this page with more info!
